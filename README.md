# README
Hello, this is my first project written on Ruby on Rails.
This project is called finance manager, in it you can create categories, change them and delete them.
According to the categories, you can create transactions with the type of income or expense, date, description and amount.
You can also generate reports at certain time intervals.
There are two types of reports by date and by category, where these reports show a graph and everything I spent or earned during a certain period.
Also, this project is already deployed.
